# About the Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains comprehensive information about COVID-19 cases from various countries. The key features include:

date: Date of the record
state: State or province
country: Country or region
lat: Latitude of the location
long: Longitude of the location
confirmed: Number of confirmed cases
deaths: Number of deaths
recovered: Number of recoveries
active: Number of active cases (calculated as confirmed - deaths - recovered)

# Data Preprocessing
# Loading Data:
The dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame for inspection.
Basic information about the dataset, such as the number of entries and data types of each column, was reviewed.

# Renaming Columns:
Renamed columns for consistency and ease of use.

# Calculating Active Cases:
Calculated the number of active cases by subtracting deaths and recoveries from confirmed cases.

# Data Visualization
# Bar Plots and Choropleth Maps:
Created bar plots to visualize the distribution of confirmed, active, and death cases.
Used Plotly to create choropleth maps to visualize the global spread of active cases.

# Trend Analysis
Top Countries with Most Active Cases:
Identified countries with the highest number of active cases on the latest date in the dataset.

# Time Series Analysis:
Analyzed the trend of confirmed, active, and death cases over time.
Forecasting with FB Prophet

# Confirmed Cases Forecasting:
Used the FB Prophet library to forecast the number of confirmed cases for the next week.
Plotted the forecasted values along with the actual data.

# Recovered Cases Forecasting:
Forecasted the number of recovered cases for the next week using FB Prophet.
Plotted the forecasted values along with the actual data.

# Deaths Forecasting:
Forecasted the number of deaths for the next week using FB Prophet.
Plotted the forecasted values along with the actual data.

# Evaluation
The visualization and forecasting techniques provided valuable insights into the spread and trends of COVID-19.
The use of FB Prophet for forecasting allowed for reliable predictions based on historical data.
The interactive visualizations helped in understanding the geographical spread of the virus.

# Conclusion
The analysis revealed significant patterns in the spread of COVID-19 across different countries and over time. Key findings include:

Certain countries have significantly higher numbers of active cases.
The trend analysis showed the progression of the pandemic over time.
The forecasting models provided reasonable predictions for future cases, recoveries, and deaths.
These insights can help policymakers and health organizations in understanding the impact of COVID-19 and planning interventions. The visualizations and forecasts provide a clear picture of the pandemic's progression, aiding in data-driven decision-making.
